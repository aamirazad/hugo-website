      <description>What I am going to try to do with this project Goodnight is a project inspired by vlogbrothers. The idea of this channal was to have two bothers making youtube videos about what they learned addressed to each other. The goal of this project is kinda similer but instead of a brother or another person I am making websites to myself about what I learned in tech that week.
No promises I am horribly bad at keeping myself to do one thing.</description>
